					<h3>
						<p>What might we<br />
						&mdash; 1,827,087 graduates since 1987 &mdash;<br />
						 do together?</p>
					</h3>

						<p>We already do these things together: we learn about art, go
						into debt, circulate ideas, support the economy, and
						(re)produce relationships and identities.</p>

						<p>Can we satisfy our collective aspirations and
						curiosities?</p>

						<p>If people pursue arts degrees out of a drive for community,
						craft, risk, audience, and knowledge, then how might we meet
						these needs and desires together, for a lifetime, not only 2-4
						years?</p> 

						<p>Imagine that this September, instead of matriculating at a
						traditional 4-year school, prospective freshmen and first-year
						MFA students pool the money they would otherwise spend on
						tuition. The class of 2018 (around 100,000 students paying
						$25,576 on average) would have $2,157,600,000 to work
						with.*</p>

						<p>If only 1/2000th of the class of 2018 pools money, say if only
						fifty prospective students band together, this group would have
						$1,078,800 to work with. That is enough to buy a building and
						own it collectively, into perpetuity, to create a lifelong
						school and community land trust.</p>

						<p>Applications for such a lifelong school will open on January 15,
						2014. To inquire about this school in advance, please email
						<a href="mailto:info@bfamfaphd.com">info@bfamfaphd.com</a>.</p>

					<h2>*</h2>
					<p>The data was collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
					(<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/about/">IPEDS</a>), was downloaded by Jackie Armstrong, corrected for
					population growth by Agnes Szanyi and organized in an excel
					spreadsheet, and visualized by Annelie Berner. IPEDS tracks BAs
					and BFAs, MAs and MFAs, and PhDs in the following categories:
					Visual and Performing Arts, General Crafts/Craft Design, Folk Art
					&amp; Artisanry, Dance, Design and Applied Arts, Drama/Theater Arts
					and Stagecraft, Film/Video and Photographic Arts, Music, Fine and
					Studio Arts.</p>


					<p>How many of “us” are there? The question seems simple. The
					National Endowment for the Arts uses U.S. Census data that
					records people who identify their primary occupation and means of
					generating income as “artist.” We are using graduation data
					because it yields the number of people who aspire to be artists,
					as well as the number of people who go into debt for creative
					fields. According to the IPEDS, in the United States alone,
					colleges and universities have graduated 1,827,087 "creatives"
					since 1987. And so this project, inspired by these questions: If
					we produce identities, not just artworks, what does it mean to
					make work when there are more artists than lawyers, doctors, or
					police officers in the United States? Can we, both as graduates
					in creative fields and non-degree artists, dream differently
					about ourselves?</p>

					<p>Starting January 1, 2015, fifty prospective BFA, MFA, and PhD students will pool $200-2000 a month for four years, generating $2,400,000. Rather than going into debt to belong to a 2-4 year community in a traditional school, this group will use $2.4M to buy a building, create a community land trust, and secure space for place-based art, community organizing, internet activism, and community resilience, in perpetuity.
