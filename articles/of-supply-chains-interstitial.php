      Of Supply Chains is a teaching tool that traces the life cycle of projects — the ways materials are sourced, how the labor for producing a project is organized, how tools are accessed, how a project is supported, licensed, narrated, encountered, acquired, and how it finally departs, ready for another life cycle. Of Supply Chains provides a vocabulary and a set of practices to think through economies of solidarity in the arts.
